My friend loves to send me memes that has cats in it! One day, he sent me another cat meme from his 4-bit computer, this time with “a secret”, he said. Unfortunately, he didn’t know sending the meme from his 4-bit computer sorta altered the image. Can you help me repair the image and find the secret?
