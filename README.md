# COMPFEST 15 Capture The Flag
List of CTF Compfest challenges I completed. This write-up was written so that I don't forget the steps I worked on in completing the challenge. The write-up consists of 2 rounds:

## HackerClass Session (Warm-up)
**[Write-up can be read here](Warm-up/README.md)**. This write-up was created by myself (*excluding Web Exploitation*). I wrote it in a very beginner friendly way because I'm still learning, especially for Binary Exploitation.

## Qualification Round
**[Write-up can be read here](Qualification/)**. This write-up was created by me and my team (No PWN No CRY), tribute to : [PwnEater](https://github.com/yudhaprimadiansyah), and Bilan. The qualification round lasted 12 hours with more than 200+ teams participated on this round.
